# MagicLeap-Totem

Just playing around with the Lumin SDK in Unity

## How to "Play"

Use the "C" gesture to drop totem into the world, and watch him bounce around.

He should detect obstacles and change direction to navigate around. This is all very work-in-progress.

If he gets stuck or jumps out of the world, use the "Pinch" gesture to grab him again.

You can turn off the visibility of the world mesh (after meshing looks ok) with the thumbs up gesture.
